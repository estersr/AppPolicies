# **Privacy Policy**

By using this app, you agree to our data practices. We collect basic information (like your email and usage data) to provide and improve the app. Some features may request optional permissions (e.g., camera or location), but you can decline these in your device settings. We never sell your personal data and only share it with trusted service providers when necessary for app functionality.

# **Camera & Facial Data Usage**

This app uses the TrueDepth camera system to track facial movements and eye direction in real time to enhance your experience during specific exercises.
This data is never recorded, stored, or transmitted—it is processed entirely on your device, and used only while exercises are active.

We do not use this facial data for identification, authentication, or advertising purposes. Use of the TrueDepth camera is purely functional and limited to app features that rely on real-time face and eye tracking.
